			Hi!

The sacsymb writings package has symbols developed with tikz. These
are the variables used in the space of the collapse of the wave function of a
quantum field associated with the micro-tubule while exploring an Orchestrated, objective reduction (Orch OR) theory of consciousness as applied to
the three brains model of psychological experience.

It is an artist rendition of a “sacred unknowable” language. I wish to
use the symbols for a mathematical model using the symbols as variables to
represent electrical signals in the body. 

There is a style file (sty/sacsymb.sty), and a latex file (doc/sacsymb.tex).
For installation, put this somewhere where LaTeX can find it.
