# `liftarm`

## Geometric constructions with liftarms using Ti*k*Z and LaTeX3

Version 3.0 (2024/05/20)

This package is based on the package [Ti*k*Z](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) and can be used to draw geometric constructions with liftarms using Ti*k*Z. There are several options for the appearance of the liftarms. It provides an environment to connect multiple liftarms using the Newton-Raphson method and LU decomposition. It also provides an environment to describe a construction and a method to animate a construction with one or more traces.
