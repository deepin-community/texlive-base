This library defines some commands for drawing braid diagrams with TikZ/PGF.
The initial idea of this package came from a question and answer on the site https://tex.stackexchange.com.

The package comes in two versions: a package (braids.sty) and a TikZ library (tikzlibrarybraids.code.tex).  The original package (braids.sty) is depreciated and has been frozen at version 1.1.  The TikZ library is maintained and should be used in preference, except for legacy code.
