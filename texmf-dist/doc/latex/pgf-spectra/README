This is pgf-spectra, version 3.0.1 (27/04/2023).

This package provides the \pgfspectra[<options>] command which draws continuous and emission or absorption spectra for 98 elements and their ions.
It was developed mainly for the writing of my own documentation and exams sheets supporting directly PDF output format.
The drawing is made with the TikZ package and is based in the pst-spectra extension for PSTricks.
It also allows the user to draw a spectrum with their own personal data.
The lines data extends from Extreme UV to Near IR (from 10 to 4000 nanometers).
It is possible to redshift the lines of a spectrum, by directly entering the redshift value or the velocity and the angle to compute the redshift value.
Spectral lines data can be presented in a table or exported to a file.
This package also provides color conversion (correlated color temperature), shadings for use with TikZ and/or PGFPLOTS, color maps for use with PGFPLOTS, 
displaying the spectral lines in a table and exporting the lines data files.

*** v3.0.1 (27/04/2023) ***
Fixed a small bug dealing with the 'axis label'/'axis label text' background color, which occurred when setting a visible background with the 'back' key, e.g., 
\pgfspectra[element=H,axis label text={wavenumber in nanometer},back=visible50]

*** v3.0.0 (25/04/2023) ***

In the \pgfspectra command, syntax for the key 'lines' has been updated: it is now possible to specify a continuous range using 'start wavelength to end 
wavelength', for instance, 'lines={380 to 500}' or 'lines={380 to 500,633}' or 'lines={633,555,380 to 500}'.
New keys for \pgfspectra:
- axis label
- axis label text
- axis label position
New command:
- \usepgfspectralibrary (loads pgf-spectra libraries)
New library 'data' to load spectral lines data, display it in a table or export it to a file. This library provides the commands:
- \pgfspectradata (loads data)
- \pgfspectratable (displays data in a table)
- \pgfspectrawrite (writes data to a file)
Some commands from previous versions have been moved to new libraries:
- \pgfspectraplotshade and \pgfspectraplotmap moved to new library 'pgfplots'
- \tempercolor moved to new library 'tempercolor'
- \pgfspectrarainbow moved to new library 'rainbow'

Previous versions

*** v2.2.0 (21/02/2023) ***
LSE data renormalized to lower values within TeX capabilities. This prevents 'Dimension too large' errors and subsequent errors in spectrum drawing when 
using the 'relative intensity' key.
Added maximum intensities in IR, visible an UV ranges for both data sources (NIST and LSE). Now, when using the 'relative intensity' key, the interval of 
wavelengths is detected and the respective maximum intensity is used. For example, if the spectrum is within the visible range, say between 400 and 700 
nanometers, the maximum visible intensity will be used. The same is true for ranges only in IR or UV ranges. But, if the spectrum to be drawn is in more 
than one region - for example, from 300 to 1000 or from 400 to 1000 or from 300 to 700 nanometers - the maximum intensity that will be used is defined 
as the maximum intensity of all data.
Fixed some typos in the manual.

*** v2.1.2 (03/07/2021) ***
Minor fix: wrong char encoding (pgf-spectra.sty, line:1555)

*** v2.1.1 (27/06/2021) ***
Major changes:
Small documentation enhancements.

*** v2.1.0 (12/05/2021) ***
