This is pgf-PeriodicTable, version 2.1.4 (2024/09/08).

The purpose of this package is to provide the Periodic Table of Elements in
a simple way. It relies on pgf/TikZ to offer a full or partial periodic table with
a variety of options and displaying the desired data for all the 118
elements. It can be done in different languages: English, French, German,
Portuguese (from Portugal and from Brazil), Spanish, Italian and translations
by user contributions (currently Dutch).
____________________________________________________________

Just typeset \pgfPT to get a Periodic Table of Elements or \pgfPT[<options list>]
to do it at your custom way.

Major changes:

*** v2.1.4 (08/09/2024) ***
Fixed wrong box width on extra legend of Country of Discovery.
Fixed minor issues in pgfPTbuildcell macros.
Added the prefix 'pgfPT' to the built-in back color schemes. They are now 'pgfPTdefault', 'pgfPTSoft', 'pgfPTJmol',
'pgfPTCPK', 'pgfPTRasmol', 'pgfPTRasmolNew', 'pgfPTWikipedia', 'pgfPTMNM', 'pgfPTPS', 'pgfPTRadio' and 'pgfPTBlocks'.
Fixed some typos in the manual.

*** v2.1.3 (07/08/2024) ***
The engine's detection mechanism (pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX or XeTeX) has been changed to prevent erroneous detection when the packages 'hyperref' or 'bookmark' are loaded and the document is compiled with LuaLaTeX - in this case, pgf-PeriodicTable disturbs the selection of the document font.
Fixed an issue with the Chemical Symbol color when a non-rgb color is used, such as cyan or yellow , which are defined in the xcolor package using the cmyk model (when loaded without options).

*** v2.1.2 (01/08/2024) ***
Fixed incorrect Spanish translations of some element names.
Minor code improvements to eliminate runtime warnings («LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `TU/TeXGyreHeros(0)/l/n' undefined» or «Missing character: There is no m (U+006D) in font nullfont!» ... )

*** v2.1.1 (07/07/2024) ***
New keys:
- group numbers (to display group numbers in arabic numerals, Roman numerals or both)
- Roman label color (sets the color of the Roman numerals)
- O Roman (the oxidation numbers are presnted in Roman numerals)

*** v2.1.0a (03/04/2024) ***
Translation files have been renamed from 'lang.{undefined,nl}.tex' to 'pgfPT.lang.{undefined,nl}.tex' to match the runtime tree of TeX Live (names must be globally unique for reliable searching).

*** v2.1.0 (14/02/2024) ***
New options for package loading:
- numerals (supporting Devanagari or Mandarin numerals);
- userlang (supporting a user defined language, currently only Dutch translation, provided by Wim De Borggraeve).
New commands:
- \pgfPTdvnfont (provides font selection for use with Devanagari);
- \pgfPTzhfont (provides font selection for use with Mandarin numerals);
- \pgfPTzhnumber (to enable/disable showing the atomic number, period or group number in Mandarin numerals).
Fixed wrong interaction with fontspec and babel packages: font selection schemes and \babelfont usage now work as expected.
Fixed incorrect capitalization of some elements in German.
Correction of the title in Spanish.

*** v2.0.1 (29/05/2023) ***
Capitalized element names (in German) and improved German language after suggestions made by Ole Schwen

*** v2.0.0 (20/02/2023) ***
New command \usepgfPTlibrary
New library 'colorschemes' for easy creation of color schemes with the commands:
- \pgfPTGroupColors

- \pgfPTCScombine
- \pgfPTCSwrite

*** v1.0.1 (08/11/2022) ***
Now compatible with pdfLaTex, LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX engines.
Fixed the 'String contains an invalid utf-8 sequence...' error.
Added \pgfPTsetLanguage{<language flag>} command to the documentation (forgotten in v1.0.0 manual).
Updated the behavior of the 'capitalize element names' key.
New keys:
