Memoize is a package for externalization of graphics and memoization of
compilation results in general, allowing the author to reuse the results of
compilation-intensive code.

Memoize (i) induces very little overhead, as all externalized graphics is
produced in a single compilation. It features (ii) automatic recompilation upon
the change of code or user-adjustable context, and (iii) automatic
externalization of TikZ pictures and Forest trees, easily extensible to other
commands and environments. Furthermore, Memoize (iv) supports
cross-referencing, TikZ overlays and Beamer, (v) works with all major engines
and formats, and (vi) is adaptable to any workflow.
