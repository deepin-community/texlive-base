      interface to access \LaTeX{}-based typesetting capabilities in
      MetaPost.  The text to be typeset is given as string. This
      allows even dynamic text elements, for example counters, to be
      used in labels. Compared to other implementations it is much
      more flexible, since it can be used as direct replacement for
      , and much faster, compared for example to the
