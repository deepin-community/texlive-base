1. Introduction
 Molecular Coding Format(MCF) is new linear notation represent
 chemical structure diagrams.
 This Coding is named from programing technique
 such as operator, array, scope, macro, adressing, etc.
 mcf2graph convert from MCF to SVG, PNG, EPS, MOL file.
 It is also able to calculate molecular weight, exact mass, molecular formula.

2. The distribution of software
 ( 1) README             This file
 ( 2) CHANGELOG          Changelog file of mcf2graph
 ( 3) mcf_to_graph.cmd   Batch file for compile MCF lib
                          >mcf_to_graph template_lib.mcf
                         drag and drop library files on this batch
                         create svg in ./template_lib

3. How to use mcf2graph with MetaPost
 Minimum requirement to use mcf2graph : mpost.exe,mpost.dll,mpost.mp,plain.mp
 (1) >mcf_to_graph        filename.mcf => output svg(default),png,mol,report
 (2) >mpost               filename.mp  => output svg file
 (3) >mpost -s ahangle=1  filename.mp  => output png file (600dpi)
 (4) >mpost -s ahangle=11 filename.mp  => output png file (1200dpi)
 (5) >mpost -s ahangle=2  filename.mp  => output eps(.mps) file
 (6) >mpost -s ahangle=3  filename.mp  => output eps(.eps) file
 (7) >mpost -s ahlength=5 filename.mp  => output mol file(V2000)
 (8) >mpost -s ahlength=6 filename.mp  => output mol file(V3000)
 (9) >mpost -s ahlength=7 filename.mp  => output report file
