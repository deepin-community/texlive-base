This package gives a simple and higly-configurable way of using unicode and 
OpenType mathematics with plain LuaTeX, making use of most of the latter 
engine’s new capabilities in mathematical typesetting. Also included are proper 
settings and definitions for nearly all unicode mathematical characters, as 
well as a few shorthands and helper macros that seemed useful additions.

Load the package by saying ⟦\input minim-math.tex⟧; this will set up luatex for 
using opentype mathematical fonts and unicode math input.
It will not, however, select mathematical fonts for you. That you will have to 
do for yourself; see below for instructions.


\section Styles and alphabets

For some (mostly alphabetical) characters, multiple variants are available, 
e.g. $\mit A \mup A \mbf A \mbfit A \mbb A \frak A \bffrak A \scr A \bfscr A$.
You can (locally) override the default style of these with
⟦*\mathstyle {style}⟧ (equivalent to the old ⟦\bf⟧, ⟦\rm⟧ etc.)
or with one of the shorthands that apply the style to their argument only:
\smallskip\smallskip\automarktable \halign{\qquad
     #\unskip\quad\hfil &#\unskip\quad\hfil &#\unskip\hfil\cr
Shorthand\quad\strut & Value of ⟦style⟧\quad\strut & Result \cr
⟦*\mup⟧    & ⟦up⟧/⟦rm⟧   & $\mup {ABC}$    \cr
⟦*\mit⟧    & ⟦it⟧        & $\mit {ABC}$    \cr
⟦*\mbf⟧    & ⟦bf⟧        & $\mbf {ABC}$    \cr
⟦*\mbfit⟧  & ⟦bfit⟧      & $\mbfit {ABC}$  \cr
⟦*\mbb⟧    & ⟦bb⟧        & $\mbb {ABC}$    \cr
⟦*\frak⟧   & ⟦frak⟧      & $\frak {ABC}$   \cr
⟦*\bffrak⟧ & ⟦bffrak⟧    & $\bffrak {ABC}$ \cr
⟦*\scr⟧    & ⟦cal⟧/⟦scr⟧ & $\scr {ABC}$    \cr
⟦*\bfscr⟧  & ⟦bfscr⟧     & $\bfscr {ABC}$  \cr
}
Styles without shorthand are ⟦sans⟧/⟦sf⟧, ⟦sfit⟧, ⟦sfbf⟧, ⟦sfbfit⟧, ⟦tt⟧/⟦mono⟧ 
and finally the special value ⟦*clear⟧ for using the default style.
You can use the shorthands directly in sub- and superscripts: ⟦v^\scr F⟧ will 
result in $v^\scr F$\kern-4pt.

While math families are not used anymore for switching between styles (see 
below), you still can use ⟦\fam⟧ with the values 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 or~7 for 
doing so. This means that plain tex’s ⟦\rm⟧, ⟦\it⟧, ⟦\cal⟧, ⟦\sl⟧, ⟦\bf⟧ and 
⟦\tt⟧ can still be used (at least in math mode).

Please note that ⟦*\mup⟧ is not the right choice for upright multiletter 
symbols or operators: you should use ⟦*\mord⟧ or ⟦*\mop⟧ instead (see near the 
end of this chapter).
For nonmathematical text, you should use ⟦*\text⟧ instead of ⟦\mup⟧.

The default properties of characters can be set with one of the following three 
commands:
\startlist
\item\ignore. ⟦*\mathmap   {character list} {style}⟧
\item\ignore. ⟦*\mathclass {character list} {class}⟧
\item\ignore. ⟦*\mathfam   {character list}   nr⟧
\stoplist
There, ⟦style⟧ is one of the above and ⟦class⟧ is the name of a class as below. 
Finally, the ⟦character list⟧ should be a comma-separated list with elements of 
one of the following forms:
\startlist
{\def\⟦#1{⟦[\uppercase{#1}#1]\kern-1pt}
\item1. a list of characters, like ⟦abc⟧ or ⟦\partial⟧ or $ℝ$;
\item2. a character range, like ⟦`A-`Z⟧, ⟦65-90⟧ or ⟦"41-"5A⟧;
\item3. one of the alphabets \⟦latin⟧, \⟦greek⟧, or ⟦digits⟧;
\item4. one of the style groups ⟦bold⟧, ⟦boldgreek⟧, ⟦sans⟧, ⟦sansgreek⟧, 
⟦mono⟧, ⟦blackboard⟧, ⟦fraktur⟧ or ⟦script⟧;
\item5. the name of a math class:
⟦ord⟧, ⟦op⟧, ⟦bin⟧, ⟦rel⟧, ⟦fence⟧, ⟦open⟧, ⟦close⟧ or ⟦punct⟧.
}\stoplist

Note that unicode is somewhat irregular in its encoding of mathematical 
letters; this is taken into account when using ranges as under~(2) above. Thus,
⟦`\mscra-`\mscrz⟧ really gives you all lowercase script characters, despite 
e.g.~$ℯ$ being well outside that range.

The default style settings are ⟦\mathmap {latin, greek, Latin}{it}⟧.
Since the math family setting is not used anymore for selecting different 
styles, the default family of every symbol is zero.
Instead, you can use ⟦\mathfam⟧ for mixing fonts (see below).
The ⟦class⟧ option to ⟦\mathclass⟧ should be one of the names under~5.


\section Character variants

You can change the default appearance of several greek characters with 
⟦*\use∥-math∥-variant {chars}⟧ or ⟦*\usemathdefault {chars}⟧, where ⟦chars⟧ is 
a list of normal greek characters.
As in unicode but against tex’s tradition, the variants are 
$\usemathvariant{εθΘκπρφ}εθΘκπρφ$ and the defaults $εθΘκπρφ$.
The macros ⟦*\varepsilon⟧ etc. have been updated to reflect the unicode 
variants.

The appearance of root symbols can be set with ⟦*\closedroots⟧ ($\closedroots 
\smash{√2}$) and ⟦*\normalroots⟧ ($\smash{√2}$, the default).

Say ⟦*\unicodedots⟧ to use the unicode dots characters ($\unicodedots…⋮⋰⋱$) and 
⟦*\traditionaldots⟧ to construct these characters from periods ($\smash{…⋮⋰⋱}$, 
the default).
Both settings affect the meaning of both the actual characters and the ⟦\xdots⟧ 
macros ($\mathstyle{mono}x∈\{l,v,c,a,d\}$).
Unlike in traditional plain tex, the traditional dots are available in script 
sizes, too.

Say ⟦*\decimalcomma⟧ and have commas appear as $\decimalcomma1,2$ instead 
of~$1,2$ (⟦*\nodecimalcomma⟧ restores the default).
The explicit ⟦*\comma⟧, like ⟦*\colon⟧, will always be punctuation.

The behaviour of limits on integral signs can be set by redefining 
⟦*\intlimits⟧ (the default is ⟦\let \intlimits = \nolimits⟧).

If you want to change the meaning (inside math mode) altogether for a single 
character, you can use the commands ⟦*\mathdef⟧ and ⟦*\mathlet⟧.
For example, by default, you can use the letter ħ for the reduced planck 
constant~$ħ$;
this has been made so with ⟦*\mathdef ħ {\hbar}⟧ (you could also have said
⟦\mathlet ħ \hbar⟧).


\section Setting up fonts

The minimum you need do to set up a mathematical font is this:

⟦*\font\tenmath
    {Latin Modern Math:mode=base;script=math;ssty=0;} at 10pt
\font\tenmaths
    {Latin Modern Math:mode=base;script=math;ssty=1;} at 7pt
\font\tenmathss
    {Latin Modern Math:mode=base;script=math;ssty=2;} at 5pt
\textfont         0 = \tenmath
\scriptfont       0 = \tenmaths
\scriptscriptfont 0 = \tenmathss⟧

Note that you only have to set up the font for a single family: opentype 
mathematical fonts typically contain all necessary variants of all mathematical 
characters.
Therefore, the ⟦*\fam⟧ setting has been made a no-op (use ⟦*\setfam⟧ if you 
really need the old primitive) and the default family of all symbols has been 
set to zero.

As mentioned above, you can still change the family number of specific 
characters and this allows you to mix mathematical fonts. For instance, if you 
dislike the current blackboard bold characters, just assign a second font to 
family 
1 and say ⟦\mathfam {blackboard} 1⟧. Less useful are the parameters
⟦*\accentfam⟧, ⟦*\radicalfam⟧ and ⟦*\extensiblefam⟧ that control the family of 
all accents, radicals and extensibles.

Do note that various spacing constants are set according to the \emph{last} 
math family that is assigned to. Therefore, you should assign your main math 
font to a family after all others.


\section Shorthands and additions

You can use ⟦*\text⟧ for adding nonmathematical text to your equations.
It will behave well in sub- and superscripts:
⟦\text{word}^\text{word}⟧ gives $\smash{\text{word}^\text{word}}$.
By default, the font used is the normal mathematical font. You can change this 
by setting the ⟦*\textfam⟧ parameter to some nonzero value and assigning 
a different font to that family (see above).
You probably want to do this, since most commonly-used mathematical fonts do not 
include a normal kerning table.

All the usual arrows can be made extensible by prefacing them with an ⟦x⟧, 
including ⟦\xmapsto⟧ and ⟦\xmapsfrom⟧. Alternatively, you can use ⟦\→⟧ etc. as 
shorthands. Additionally, you can use the following:

{\smallskip\smallskip\automarktable \halign{\qquad
    \vrule width0pt depth 9pt#\unskip\hfil
    &&\qquad#\unskip\hfil\cr
Shorthand                    & Result                       \cr
⟦\bra x, \ket y⟧             & $\bra x, \ket y$             \cr
⟦\braket x y⟧                & $\braket x y$                \cr
⟦\norm x, \Norm x⟧           & $\norm x, \Norm x$           \cr
⟦x \stackrel ?= y⟧           & $x \stackrel ?= y$           \cr
⟦x \stackbin a+ y⟧           & $x \stackbin a+ y$           \cr
⟦f\inv⟧                      & $f\inv$ \quad (cf. $f^{-1}$) \cr
⟦a \xrightarrow[down]{up} b⟧ & $a \xrightarrow[down]{up} b$ \cr
⟦a \xeq[down]{up} b⟧         & $a \xeq[down]{up} b$         \cr
⟦\frac12, \tfrac12, \dfrac12⟧& $\frac12, \tfrac12, \dfrac12$\cr
}\smallskip}

Also new are the operators
⟦\Tr⟧, ⟦\tr⟧, ⟦\Span⟧, ⟦\GL⟧, ⟦\SL⟧, ⟦\SU⟧, ⟦\U⟧, ⟦\SO⟧, ⟦\O⟧,
⟦\Sp⟧, ⟦\im⟧, ⟦\End⟧, ⟦\Aut⟧, ⟦\Dom⟧ and ⟦\Codom⟧.
You can define new operators with ⟦*\newmathop⟧ and ⟦*\newlargemathop⟧: 
⟦\newmathop{op}⟧ will define the new operator ⟦\op⟧.
For single use of an upright symbol, operator or large operator you can use 
⟦*\mord⟧, ⟦*\mop⟧ and ⟦*\mlop⟧.
The difference between ⟦\mord⟧ and ⟦\mup⟧ is that ⟦\mord⟧ also applies the 
correct symbol spacing.

The accents ⟦\overbrace⟧, ⟦\underbracket⟧ etc. allow a label between square 
brackets:
⟦$$\underbrace[=1]{(x^2+∥penalty0y^2)}$$⟧ gives
$$\underbrace[=1]{(x^2 + y^2)}.$$


\section Best practices

The following remarks on mathematical typesetting have no relation to the 
contents of this package; I have included them because I find them hard to 
remember.

\startlist
\item1. ⟦*\eqalign⟧ gives a vertically centered box and can occur many times in 
an equation, while ⟦*\eqalignno⟧ and ⟦*\leqalignno⟧ span whole lines (put the 
equation numbers in the third column). All assume the relation (or operator) 
appears at the right hand side of the ampsersand.
\item2. The command ⟦*\displaylines⟧ can only have one column that spans the 
whole line (and you will have to add the equation number by hand).
\item3. Further alignment commands are ⟦*\cases⟧, ⟦*\matrix⟧, ⟦*\pmatrix⟧ (with 
parentheses) and ⟦*\bordermatrix⟧ (includes labels for lines and columns).
\item4. Finetuning alignments can be done with ⟦*\smash⟧, ⟦*\phantom⟧, 
⟦*\hphantom⟧ and ⟦*\vphantom⟧.
\item5. Small matrices like $1\;2\choose3\;4$ can be made by misusing 
⟦*\choose⟧ or ⟦*\atop⟧.
\item6. If you start a line with a binary operator, put a ⟦*{}⟧ before it: this 
way, tex recognises it as such.
\item7. Thin spaces (⟦*\,⟧) should be inserted: before $\mup dx$, before units, 
after factorials and after ⟦*\dots⟧ if those are followed by a closing 
parenthesis.
\item8. Whether the differential operator should be set upright or not is as of 
yet an open question in mathematics.
\item9. You should prefer ⟦*\bigr⟧ and ⟦*\bigl⟧ etc. over ⟦\big⟧, ⟦\Big⟧, 
⟦\bigg⟧ and ⟦\Bigg⟧.
\item10. An overview of mathematical symbols, with control sequences and their 
availability in different fonts, can be found in ⟦*unimath-symbols.pdf⟧, which 
is part of the unicode-math package.
