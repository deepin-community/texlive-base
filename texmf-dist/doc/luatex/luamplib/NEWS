                       History of the luamplib package

2024/01/25 2.25.3
    * protect "..." even if textextlabel is disabled (revert part of v2.25.0)

2023/12/08 2.25.2
    * info instead of warning when compiling with dviluatex

2023/08/21 2.25.1
    * explicit \par in \mplibstoptoPDF to support LaTeX's paragraph hooks

2023/08/07 2.25.0
    * propagate tex's jobname varible into mplib process as well.
    * protect "..." if and only if textextlabel is enabled.

2023/04/04 2.24.0
    respect '-recorder' command-line option

2022/01/12 2.23.0
    In parellel with the functionality introduced at previous version,
    \everymplib (\everyendmplib as well, of course) supports
    optional argument of named MetaPost instance, affecting only those
    mplibcode environments of the same name.

2022/01/09 2.22.0
    * Sergey Slyusarev (@jemmybutton) has suggested and contributed
    a new feature for LaTeX mplibcode environment, which now supports
    separately named MetaPost instances.  Using this feature,
    all the variables and functions are shared only among
    all the environments belonging to the same instance.
    (#99 and #100)

2021/11/23 2.21.1
    * address #97 (typesetting fails with "--lua" option)

2021/09/16 2.21.0
    * allow empty string in textext()

2021/08/03 2.20.9
    * initialize every mplib instance with random integer seed values

2021/08/02 2.20.8
    * when \mplibshowlog{enable} is declared, log (not term) messages
      returned by mplib instance will be printed into the .log file.

2021/03/11 2.20.7
    * emegency patch for context metafun 2021-03-06

2020/12/30 2.20.6
    * fix a bug regarding no figure output when luamplib.showlog is
      true. (#91)
    * now metapost `show' command triggers a warning message, so that
      it could be shown on the console. (#91)

2020/02/24 2.20.5
    * Extra check for \pdfliteral (PR #89)
    * allow expansion of \mpdim and \mpcolor when they are used in
      another macro
    * step copyright year

2019/12/11 2.20.4
    * remove unnecessary setting of endlinechar
    * \prependtomplibbox instead of \mplibhmodeornot

2019/11/14 2.20.3
    * fix issue #86 (LaTeX command inside metapost label)

2019/10/11 2.20.2
    * fix issue #84 (pgf package hinders \mpcolor process)

2019/03/26 2.20.1
    * '\mpdim' and '\mpcolor' are allowed, even if '\mplibverbatim' is enabled.

2019/03/20 2.20.0
    * huge changes, but mostly internal, so apparently not much difference
      from previous version.
    * '\mplibforcehmode' makes mplibcode typeset in horizontal mode.
      '\mplibnoforcehmode' reverts the setting. The latter is default.
    * '\mpliblegacybehavior{disable}' triggers a new mode of processing
      verbatimtex .. etex: along with btex .. etex, they will be processed
      sequentially one by one. Old behavior, being default, can be restored
      by declaring '\mpliblegacybehavior{enable}'.
      Incidentally, verbatimtex .. etex in MP input files is honored
      from this version, save those that contain '\documentclass'
      or '\begin{document}' etc, which is totally ignored.

2018/09/27 2.12.5
    * change dash.offset pattern from "%i" to "%f" (PR #77)
    * remove unnecessary variables that go back to context (issue #76)

    * workaround issue #70 "Labels outside beginfig...endfig are not inherited"
    * address issue #71 "metafun problem: arrow tips are not filled"
    by importing luatex-mplib.lua from context beta.

2017/06/02 2.12.1
    * when \mplibglobaltextext{enable} is declared, metapost variables
    containing btex ... etex labels can be inherited across code chunks.
    Of course, \mplibcodeinherit should also be switched on.

2016/03/31 2.11.3
    * fix a bug regarding nested mplibcode environments (issue #63)

2016/01/02 2.11.2
    * updates for luatex 0.87

2015/10/02 2.11.1
    * adapts to latex 2015/10/01 and luatexbase v1.0
    * allows `btex ... etex' and `verbatimtex ... etex' even when
      `\mplibverbatim{enable}' is declared.

2015/08/01 2.11.0
    * after `\mplibverbatim{enable}', contents of mplibcode environment
      will be read verbatim. So `btex ... etex', `verbatimtex ... etex',
      `\mpdim', `\mpcolor' are not allowed and all TeX commands will be
      fed literally into mplib library.
    * allow access to type1 fonts, which means we can use glyph
      operator now (luatex rev 5266)
    * color transparency is now compatible with pgf package and
      beamer class as well. (luatex 0.80+ is recommended)

2015/03/26 2.10.1
    * fix bug #55 regarding hash token

2015/03/20 2.10.0
    * TeX code in `VerbatimTeX()' between `beginfig();' and `endfig;'
      will be inserted after flushing out the mplib figure.
    * `\mpcolor' command accepts optional argument: for instance,
      `\mpcolor[HTML]{FF0000}'.

2015/01/26 2.9.1
    * fix a bug reported by Herbert Schulz via luatex mailing list
      (http://tug.org/pipermail/luatex/2015-January/005054.html)

2015/01/05 2.9.0
    * after declaring `\mplibcodeinherit{enable}', each mplib code chunks
      will inherit variables/constants/macros defined by previous chunks.
      On the contrary, the default value `\mplibcodeinherit{disable}' will
      treat each code chunks as an independent instance, never being affected
      by other code chunks.

2014/07/04 2.8.1
    * support color package on plain tex.
    * fix a failure at `btex \% etex'.

2014/06/17 2.8.0
    * support color/xcolor/spotcolor packages.
      On LaTeX, color names or expressions of color/xcolor packages
      can be used inside mplibcode environment with the command
      \mpcolor{<color expression>}.

2014/04/25 2.7.0
    * support DVIPDFMx
    * default directory for cache is now '$TEXMFVAR/luamplib_cache'
    * internal changes following LuaTeX engine v0.79 and luatexbase
      package v0.7
    * [fix] avoid luatex crash under math_mode 'decimal'

2014/03/26 2.6.1
    * now luamplib does not disregard 'show' command, even if
      'luamplib.showlog' is false. Incidentally, it does not raise
      error, but just prints a warning, even if output contains
      no figure.
    * fix a bug wrt color, which might come to the fore under
      math mode 'double' or 'decimal'.

2014/03/08 2.6.0
    * new macro \mplibtextextlabel{enable} enables string labels typeset
      with textext() instead of infont operator. Every string label
      thereafter will be typeset with current TeX font.
    * fixed a bug wrt btex ... etex parsing (issue #39)
    * [doc] added a mention about \MPllx, \MPlly, \MPurx, and \MPury.

2014/03/01 2.5.3
    * using \mplibcachedir{<directory path>}, users can change the
      directory for storing cache files. By default, it is the directory
      where pdf output file is saved.
    * at the end of package loading, luamplib searches 'luamplib.cfg',
      and, when found, reads the file in automatically.

2014/02/24 2.5.2
    * new macros \mplibmakenocache{...} and \mplibcancelnocache{...} to
      register/unregister those .mp files that do not need caches.
      These macros affect the compilation speed only.
    * added a hack to support graph.mp (in fact, format.mp)
    * [fix] luamplib now respects percent sign if it is enclosed by quotes.

2014/02/19 2.5
    * btex ... etex input from external *.mp files will also be processed
      by luamplib. However, verbatimtex ... etex will be entirely ignored
      in this case.

2014/02/02 2.4
    * implemented "numbersystem" option. Default value "scaled" can be
      changed by declaring \mplibnumbersystem{double}. For details, see
      http://github.com/lualatex/luamplib/issues/21

2014/01/20 2.3
    * \everymplib, \everyendmplib: macros that redefine token lists
      \everymplibtoks and \everyendmplibtoks. These will be
      automatically inserted at the beginning and ending (respectively)
      of each and every mplib code.
    * naked TeX codes, includig \mpdim{...}, are allowed inside
      mplibcode environment. Refer the manual of gmp package for
      details.

2013/12/30 2.2
    * start to support transparency/shading under metafun format.
    * verbatimtex ... etex just before beginfig() is not ignored.
      Using this macro, each mplib box can be moved horizontally and/or
      vertically.

2013/12/23 2.1.1
    * fix a bug wrt "withoutcolor" option
    * fix a bug wrt "char <number> infont <font>" picture
    * bypass some ConTeXt commands which raise errors under metafun format
    * ignore "fontmapfile <filename>" which isn't needed in mplib

2013/12/19 2.1
    * Do not ignore "withcolor" option for textext and normal text object
    * verbatimtex ... etex is now just ignored, not raising error

2013/12/11 2.03
    * implemented textext() macro which is identical to TEX() from TEX.mp.
      TEX() is a synonym of textext().
    * fix a bug regarding tex-text box inside for...endfor loop,
      reported at http://www.ktug.org/xe/index.php?document_srl=178050

2013/09/24 2.01
    * fix bug reported by Stephan Hennig: wrong baseline of tex-text box
