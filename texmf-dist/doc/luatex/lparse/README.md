# lparse

Parse and scan macro arguments in `Lua` with `LuaTeX` using a `xparse`
like argument specification.

The name lparse is derived from xparse. The x has been replaced by l
because this package only works with LuaTeX. l stands for Lua. Just as
with xparse, it is possible to use a special syntax consisting of single
letters to express the arguments of a macro. However, lparse is able to
read arguments regardless of the macro systemd used - whether LaTeX or
ConTeXt or even plain TeX. Of course, LuaTeX must always be used as the
engine.
