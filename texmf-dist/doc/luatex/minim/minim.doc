\maketitle

This is a modern plain format for the LuaTeX engine, adding improved low-level 
support for many LuaTeX extensions and newer PDF features. While it can be 
used as drop-in replacement for plain TeX, it probably is most useful as 
a basis for your own formats.

Most features included in the format are provided by separate packages that can 
be used on their own; see the packages

minim-mp&for mplib (MetaPost) support\cr
minim-math&for Unicode mathematics\cr
minim-pdf&for hypertext and Tagged PDF\cr
minim-xmp&for XMP (metadata) inclusion\cr}

The documentation for the above packages will be replicated in separate 
chapters below.

You can use this package by simply saying ⟦\input minim⟧; this will load the 
file \red{minim.tex}.
For building your own format files, you can re-use the file \red{minim.ini}:
if you define ⟦\fmtname⟧ before inputting this file, no ⟦\dump⟧ will be 
performed.

\section Compatibility

One central design goal of minim is to be as unobtrusive as possible: you 
should be able to safely ignore any function you do not want to use.
Please get in touch if you find this not the case.

Particular care has been taken to be compatible with \red{ltluatex}. All 
overlapping functions should produce the same results and ltluatex can be 
loaded either before or after minim.

One point of incompatibility exists between \red{tikz/pgf} and the pattern 
functionality of minim-mp, due to conflicting implementations of pdf resource 
management.
If you do not use filling patterns, however, the two packages can be used 
together.
