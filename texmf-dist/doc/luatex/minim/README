Version: 2024/1.6

SUMMARY

This is a modern plain format for the LuaTeX engine, adding improved low-level 
support for many LuaTeX extensions and newer PDF features. While it can be 
used as drop-in replacement for plain TeX, it probably is most useful as 
a basis for your own formats.

Most features included in the format are provided by separate packages that 
can be used on their own; see the packages

    minim-mp      for mplib (MetaPost) support
    minim-math    for unicode mathematics
    minim-pdf     for creating Tagged PDF
    minim-xmp     for XMP (metadata) inclusion

This package proper only contains their shared lowest-level programming 
interface, together with their combined format.


DOCUMENTATION

In order to obtain the typeset manual of this package, simply say:
