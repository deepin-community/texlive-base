Version: 2024/1.6

SUMMARY

This package offers low-level mplib integration for both plain LuaTeX and 
LuaLaTeX. It is designed with the purpose of being easy to extend.

The use of multiple simultaneous MetaPost instances is supported, as well as 
running TeX or lua code from within MetaPost. With the included minim-mp 
format file, you can even use LuaTeX as a stand-alone MetaPost compiler.


DOCUMENTATION

In order to obtain the typeset manual of this package, simply say:

    luatex minim-mp.doc


INSTALLATION

In order to use minim-mp as a stand-alone metapost compiler, you will have to 
generate the appropriate format files. For metapost with plain tex, say

    luatex --ini minim-mp.ini

For metapost with latex, say

    luatex --ini minim-lamp.ini

The resulting format (.fmt) files will be found if they are either in the same 
directory as your metapost source file, or in ${TEXMFHOME}/web2c/luatex (the 
latter is of course recommended).

Useful shell aliases are

    alias mpost='luatex --fmt=minim-mp'
    alias lampost='luatex --fmt=minim-lamp'
