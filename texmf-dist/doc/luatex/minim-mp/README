Version: 2024/1.4

SUMMARY

This package offers low-level mplib integration for plain LuaTeX and is 
designed with the purpose of being easy to extend.

The use of multiple simultaneous MetaPost instances is supported, as well as 
running TeX or lua code from within MetaPost. With the included minim-mp 
format file, you can even use LuaTeX as a stand-alone MetaPost compiler.
