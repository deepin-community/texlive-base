The package suppresses inappropriate ligatures following
specified rules. Both font and user kerning are applied
correctly, and f-glyphs are automatically replaced with
their short-arm variant (if available). Also there is an
emphasis on speed.
By default the package applies German language ligature
suppression rules. With the help of options and macros it
can be used for other languages as well.
The package requires LuaLaTeX.
