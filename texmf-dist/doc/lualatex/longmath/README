longmath 
--------

Nested delimiter groups extending over multiple array cells or lines. 

The longmath package provides yet another solution to some well known 
typesetting problems solved in a variety of ways: multi line formulas 
with paired and nested delimiters. It tackles the problem at the Lua 
level, which has some advantages over solutions implemented in TeX. 
In particular, the TeX code need not be executed multiple times, and 
there is no interference between TeX grouping and the nesting of 
delimiter groups.

As a byproduct, delimiters can be scaled in various ways, inner 
delimiters come in different flavours like relational and binary 
operators, punctuation symbols etc., and outer delimiters can be 
selected automatically according to the nesting level. Last but not 
least, delimiter groups can even extend across several array cells 
or across the whole document. 

A special environment is provided as well, which allows multi line
expressions to be placed inside a displayed equation and make TeX 
do the line splitting and alignment.
