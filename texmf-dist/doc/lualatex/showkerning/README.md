The package displays all kerning values in the form of
colored bars directly at the respective position in the
document. Positive values are displayed in green, negative
values in red. The width of the bars corresponds exactly
to the respective kerning value.
By option the bars can be placed behind or in front of the
glyphs.
The package requires LuaLaTeX.
