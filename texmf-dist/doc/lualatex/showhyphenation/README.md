The package shows the hyphenation points in the document
by either inserting small triangles below the baseline or
by typesetting explicit hyphens.
The markers are correctly placed even within ligatures and
their size adjusts to the font size. By option the markers
can be placed behind or in front of the glyphs.
The package requires LuaLaTeX.
