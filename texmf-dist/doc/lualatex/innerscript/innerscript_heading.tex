\centerline{\bfseries Overview\strut}
\noindent The \textsf{innerscript} package optionally modifies four aspects of \TeX's automatic math formatting to improve typesetting: (1) it adds extra space around relation and operation symbols in superscripts and subscripts; (2) it removes extra space around |\left|-|\right| delimiter pairs; (3) it adds extra space after right delimiters in certain situations; and (4) it forces |\left| and |\right| delimiters to completely cover their contents. Using Lua\LaTeX\ is required.\par}
