            LaTeX Package innerscript v. 1.2
               Installation Guide/README
                    Conrad Kosowsky


This file is README.txt from version 1.2 of the free and
open-source LaTeX package "innerscript," released November
2023, to be used with the LuaTeX engine. The innerscript
package optionally modifies four aspects of TeX's automatic
math formatting rules to improve typesetting. See the user
guide for more information. See below for installation and
license information.

*********************************************************

To install innerscript automatically, update your TeXLive or
MacTeX distribution or use a package manager such as tlmgr.

To install innerscript manually requires two steps as follows.

Step 1: You need to generate the package file innerscript.sty
from innerscript_code.dtx. You can do this in two ways:

  (1) Running Plain TeX on innerscript_code.dtx will create
      innerscript.sty as well as several other tex files that
      can be used for typesetting documentation.

  (2) Running LaTeX on innerscript_code.dtx will produce the
      files listed in point (1) including innerscript.sty as
      well as innerscript_code.pdf, which documents the 
      package code.

Step 2: Once you have created innerscript.sty, you should
move it into a directory searchable by TeX to complete the
installation. If you are unsure how to do this, consult your
TeX distribution.

*********************************************************

Besides this README, the installation contains the following
items:

  (1) innerscript_code.dtx: the main file. See above for
      instructions to generate innerscript.sty from this
      file and complete the installation.

  (2) innerscript_code.pdf: documentation of the package
      code.

  (3) innerscript_user_guide.pdf: a user guide.

Typesetting innerscript_code.dtx will create
innerscript_user_guide.tex, which is the tex file that
produces the user guide in point (3) above.
