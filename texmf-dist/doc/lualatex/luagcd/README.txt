# Introduction
Using Lua, the luagcd package is developed to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers in LaTeX.
The package provides commands to obtain step-by-step computation of gcd of two integers by using the Euclidean algorithm. 
In addition, the package has the command to express gcd of two integers as a linear combination. 
The Bezoutâ€™s Identity can be verified for any two integers using commands in the package. 
No particular environment is required for the use of commands in the package. 
It is written in Lua, and the TeX file has to be compiled with the LuaLaTeX engine.
