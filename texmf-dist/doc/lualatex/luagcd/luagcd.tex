\section{Introduction}\label{section:introduction}
Using Lua, the \verb|luagcd| package is developed to find the \textbf{greatest common divisor (gcd)} of integers in LaTeX. It provides an easy way to find gcd of two or more integers inside LaTeX documents. The package provides commands to obtain step-by-step computation of gcd of two integers by using Euclidean algorithm. In addition, the package has the command to express gcd of two integers as a linear combination. The Bezoutâ€™s Identity can be verified for any two integers using commands in the package. No particular environment is required for the use of commands in the package. It is written in Lua, and the TeX file has to be compiled with the LuaLaTeX engine.

In order to find the gcd of two integers, \(a\) and \(b\), the package uses a repeated division algorithm. This technique is basically based on the fact \(\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(a,b-\lambda a)\), where \(\lambda\) is an integer. This technique to find the gcd of integers is called as Euclidean algorithm. For finding gcd of more than two numbers, the associativity of the gcd operation is used.
\[\gcd(\gcd(a,b),c)=\gcd(a,b,c)\]
This associativity of the gcd operation allows the recursion of functions to find the gcd of more than two integers. The recursion technique (where the function calls itself) in Lua is effectively used in the package for finding the gcd of integers. The package also makes use of the following result.
 \[\gcd\{a,b\}=\gcd\{|a|,b\}=\gcd\{a,|b|\}=\gcd\{|a|,|b|\} \]
 
 Algorithms in the package convert non-zero integers to positive integers, and then the Euclidean algorithm is used to find their gcd. If the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(d\)  and it is expressed as a linear combination \(ax+by=d\), then we have
 \[ax+by=d \iff (-a)(-x)+by = d \iff ax+(-b)(-y) = d \iff (-a)(-x)+(-b)(-y) = d \]

So in order to find a solution of \((-a)(-x)+by = d\), \( ax+(-b)(-y) = d\) or \((-a)(-x)+(-b)(-y) = d\)  it suffices to find a solution of \(ax+by=d \). This fact is used in an algorithm of the package to express the gcd of two integers as their linear combination.

\section{Installation and License}

The installation of \verb|luagcd| package is similar to plain latex package, where the \texttt{.sty} file is in LaTeX directory of texmf tree. The package can be included with \verb|\usepackage{luagcd}| command in the preamble of the LaTeX document. The TeX file is to be compiled using the LuaLaTeX engine.

The \verb|luagcd| package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later. The complete license text is available at \url{http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt}. It is developed in Lua.  Lua is available as a certified open-source software. Its license is simple and liberal, which is compatible with GPL.
